# ToDoList
Individual project during System developer .NET studies @ Lexicon. Written in C#.

## Project description
A console app that allows the user to manage a ToDo/task list.
When creating a ToDo it is also saved to a list.
The list is saved to a text file which makes it possible to close the app and open with the former state restored.

### A ToDo (task) includes:
- Title/task
- Project
- Due date
- Status (done/not done)
  
### The user can:
- Create ToDo
- View ToDo list, sorted by due date, project or status
- Edit ToDo, change status, remove ToDo
- Quit

## Room for improvement
- Create more reusable methods.
- Find ways to create more classes and move some methods.
